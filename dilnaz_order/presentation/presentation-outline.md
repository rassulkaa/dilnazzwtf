## Slide 5: Methodology Overview

### Hybrid Forecasting Approach

**Traditional Statistical Methods**
- Moving averages (3-month, 12-month)
- Seasonal adjustment factors
- Trend analysis and regression

**AI/Neural Network Enhancement**
- Deep learning pattern recognition
- External factor integration
- Ensemble model predictions
- Continuous learning from new data

### Formula
```
Forecast = (Base Trend × Seasonality Index) + AI Adjustment
```

### Seasonality Index
```
Index = Period Demand / Average Monthly Demand
```
- Index > 1.0: Peak season
- Index < 1.0: Off-season
