# Background Music Note

## Audio File Required

The website is configured to play background music from:
`assets/music/analytics-background-music.mp3`

## Options to Add Music:

### Option 1: AI Music Generation Services
Use one of these services to generate professional ambient background music:
- **Mubert** (https://mubert.com) - AI music generation
- **AIVA** (https://www.aiva.ai) - AI composer
- **Soundraw** (https://soundraw.io) - AI music generator

### Option 2: Royalty-Free Music
Download ambient/corporate music from:
- YouTube Audio Library
- Free Music Archive
- Incompetech

### Option 3: Disable Music
If you don't want background music, you can:
1. Remove the `<audio>` element from `index.html` (line ~450)
2. Remove music control code from `js/main.js`

## Recommendations:
- **Style**: Ambient, instrumental, minimalist
- **Mood**: Professional, calm, focused
- **Tempo**: Slow to moderate (60-90 BPM)
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes (will loop)
- **Volume**: Low/subtle (website sets to 15% by default)

## Current Status:
Music file is NOT included in the project. The website will work fine without it - the audio element will simply not play.
